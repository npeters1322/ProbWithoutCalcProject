# Probability Without Calculus Project

While first learning hypothesis testing, I created a project to test whether there was a decrease in average 3-point shooting percentage after the 3-point line was extended for men in NCAA basketball. Although this doesn't determine if the cause was the extension, it still provides valuable insight into if there actually was a significant decrease in average percentage. In the end, I found that there was a statistically significant decrease in average 3-point shooting percentages after the extension of the 3-point line.
